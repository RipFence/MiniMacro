# MiniMacro
Keyboard Macro device for ESP32S2

My daughter has to type repetitive messages for work, but this agrivates a shoulder injury.  In an effort to help, I created a macro keyboard--six colored buttons connected to an ESP32S2.  Connect it to a computer via USB cable and it acts like any other keyboard.  Each button can be clicked or double-clicked and will "type" a string of up to 2048 characters.  Up to 12 macros in all.

How do you set up the macros?  When powered up for the first time, it creates an access point that you can connect to and configure it for your own WiFi network.  Once connected to a WiFi network, you can point your browser to http://minimacro.local and to bring up a configuration page.  Set the macro for each button tap or double-tap then click Save.  You can also reset the device to "factory" defaults from here.  All information is stored locally in flash.

Enjoy!
